        <li class="hobbies values-li">
          This course is an introduction to computer science covering the
          foundations of computer science and basic programming, with an
          emphasis on developing logical thinking and problem-solving skills.
          <br />
          Each unit of the course is broken down into lessons. Lessons consist
          of video tutorials, short quizzes, example programs to explore, and
          written programming exercises. Each unit ends with a comprehensive
          unit test. In this course, you will write and run JavaScript programs
          in the browser using the CodeHS editor. <br />
          Prerequisites: This course is designed for beginners and does not
          require any computer programming experience. The course is intended to
          be highly visual, dynamic, and interactive for new coders.
